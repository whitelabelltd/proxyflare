# Proxyflare
Proxy for handling Cloudflare functions. 

#### Why

Avoids having to put your Global Cloudflare API Key on end-user sites. Requires the domain added to the main Whitelabel Digital dashboard before it can be used.

#### Functions

- Cache Clear
- Development Toggle


## Install
1. Intsall Plugin
2. Under Tools > Proxyflare
3. Enter the API Credentials and Save ( credentials can be obtained from Whitelabel Digital )
4. Done

## How it works
#### Manually 
In the admin bar the user can clear the cache.

#### Automatic
When WP-Rocket is installed it will clear the Cloudflare cache each time WP-Rocket clears the site cache.
